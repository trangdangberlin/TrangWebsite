      Jan 26th: I am about to create a presentation with the topic "How to
      encourage young women to learn coding."
    </li>
    <li>
      Jan 25th: Coding is empowering. Once I started, I tried to focus on a
      problem that I wanted to solve. From there, I knew which coding language I
      needed, rather than learning every single language. I focused on a
      solution to my problem.
    </li>
    <li>
      Jan 25th: For that person, that woman, that young woman out there: Yes,
      coding is hard, but it is as hard for men, too. So don't give up. It can
      be overwhelming at the beginning, but that's where you need to continue.
    </li>
    <li>In 2024, I am dedicated to learning web development.</li>
    <li>
      I added JavaScript to my HTML code to incorporate more complex features,
      such as the color-changing button.
    </li>
    <li>
      I started adding a CSS file to my HTML code. It's a game-changer to style
      and format in one place.
    </li>
    <li>In 2024, I am committed to learning web development.</li>
    <li>With each commit, I witness real-time changes in my work.</li>
    <li>This initial prototype was created in Italy while awaiting dinner.</li>
    <li>Today marks my second line of progress.</li>
